Simple Machine Learning model

### what is a predictive model??

- Using historical data use predictibe modelling to determine a certain output.
- Essentially, with predictive programming, you collect historical data, analyze it, and train a model that detects specific patterns so that when it encounters new data later on, it’s able to predict future results.
- Different algorithms are, neural networks, decision trees, k-means clustering and Naive Bayes.

  ### Explore the data set

  - It’s important to know your way around the data you’re working with so you know how to build your predictive model. For this reason, Python has several functions that will help you with your explorations.
#### info()
- The info() function shows us the data type of each column, number of columns, memory usage, and the number of records in the dataset:

`` df.info() ``

#### Shape 

The shape function displays the number of records and columns:

df.shape

#### describe()

The describe() function summarizes the dataset’s statistical properties, such as count, mean, min, and max:

df.describe()

- This model uses the Linear regression model as I am just starting out, but for my next project, the euro 2024 predictor, I will use both the linear and logistic regression model, using a linear graph and signmoid curve graph respectively.

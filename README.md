# Olympic Medal Prediction Model

## Overview
This machine learning project aims to predict the number of medals an Olympic team will win based on historical data. The model uses a dataset containing information about teams, countries, years, number of athletes, average age, previous medals, and medals won.

## Data Analysis
The initial analysis involves reading the data from a CSV file using Pandas and exploring the relationships between different variables using correlation and Seaborn's plotting capabilities.

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning steps include handling missing values, which are prevalent in teams that have not participated in previous Olympics, and removing unnecessary columns from the dataset.

## Model Training and Testing
The dataset is split into training and test sets based on the year. A Linear Regression model from Scikit-learn is trained on the training set and used to make predictions on the test set.

## Predictions
Predictions are made for the number of medals won by teams. The model ensures that predictions are non-negative and rounded to the nearest whole number.

## Error Analysis
The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric is used to evaluate the model's performance. Further analysis is conducted to understand the error distribution across different teams and to identify areas for improvement.

## Improvements
Suggestions for improving the model include adding more predictors and trying different machine learning models.

## Usage
To use this model, simply run the Python script provided in the repository. Ensure you have the required libraries installed, including Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
